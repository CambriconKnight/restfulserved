/* request_logger_plugin example
 *
 * Here we demonstrate how you can implement a simple request logger using the mux.use_before plugin
 * register. The method gets called before each request is handled.
 *
 * If you want to log requests apache style then this logger is already implemented in
 * src/served/plugins.hpp, it has to be registered with mux.use_after, like so:
 *
 * mux.use_after(served::plugins::access_log);
