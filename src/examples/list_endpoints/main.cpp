/* list_endpoints example
 *
 * This example demonstrates how to expose a list of registered API endpoints using the
 * mux.get_endpoints_list() method, which returns an iterable vector of endpoints.
 *
 * A version of this endpoints handler that prints endpoints in YAML is already written, and you can
 * use it like so:
 *
 * mux.handler("/endpoints").get(mux.get_endpoint_list_handler_YAML());
